@techreport{karapanagiotis2020invisible,
abstract = {Shortages and surpluses appear in many markets both under exceptional and typical circumstances. This article proposes an assessment of the appropriateness of market-clearing in econometric modeling. The methodology allows the comparison of equilibrium and disequilibrium models with known likelihoods. Its performance is examined in a controlled environment using large-scale simulations of five market models. An application of the methodology using US retail and scanner deodorant data shows that, during times of distress, exogenous shocks can improve the effectiveness of the price mechanism. The results of this article may serve as empirical justifications of deviations from market-clearing.},

abstract = {Since the likelihood function corresponding to finite mixtures of normal distributions is unbounded, maximum likelihood estimation may break down in practice. The article introduces the “moment generating function estimator” defined as the estimator which minimizes the sum of squares of differences between the theoretical and sample moment generating functions. The consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator are proved and its finite sample behavior is compared to that of the standard method of moments estimator by Monte Carlo experiments. The estimator is applied to the Hamermesh model of wage bargain determination. {\textcopyright} 1978, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{zilinskas2006,
abstract = {The possibility of estimating bounds for the econometric likelihood function using balanced random interval arithmetic is experimentally investigated. The experiments on the likelihood function with data from housing starts have proved the assumption that distributions of centres and radii of evaluated balanced random intervals are normal. Balanced random interval arithmetic can therefore be used to estimate bounds for this function and global optimization algorithms based on this arithmetic are applicable to optimize it. The interval branch and bound algorithms with bounds calculated using standard and balanced random interval arithmetic were used to optimize the likelihood function. Results of the experiments show that when reliability is essential the algorithm with standard interval arithmetic should be used, but when speed of optimization is more important, the algorithm with balanced random interval arithmetic should be used which in this case finishes faster and provides good, although not always optimal, values. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

@article{maddala1974,
abstract = {The paper presents maximum likelihood methods for estimating four\ntypes of disequilibrium models. In each case the model includes three\nequations: the demand equation, the supply equation, and the condition\nthat quantity observed is the minimum of quantity demanded and quantity\nsupplied. The first model consists of just these equations. In the\nsecond model one knows whether one is on the demand function or the\nsupply function by looking at the direction of the change in price.\nIn the third model the price change is assumed to be proportional\nto excess demand. In the fourth model the price change is a stochastic\nfunction of excess demand and possibly other exogenous variables.\nSome illustrative calculations are presented using the housing starts\nmodel considered by Fair and Jaffee in an earlier issue of this journal.},

@article{fair1972,
abstract = {This paper is concerned with the econometric problems associated with\nestimating supply and demand schedules in disequilibrium markets.\nThe general problem is that in the absence of an equilibrium condition\nthe ex ante demand and supply quantities cannot in general be equated\nto the observed quatity traded in the market. Four methods of estimation,\ndiffering primarily in their use of information on price-setting\nbehavior, are developed in this paper. The first method is a generalization\nof an earlier meothd developed by R. Quandt and is based upon the\nmaximization of a likelihood function. The method does not require\nany specific assumption about price-setting behavior, and it allows\nthe sample separation (into demand and supply regimes) to be estimated\nalong with the coefficient estimates. The second and third methods\nuse the change in price as a qualitative proxy in determining the\nsample separation. The fouth method uses the change in price as a\nquantitative proxy for the amount of excess demand (supply) in the\nmarket. In the final section of the paper the four methods are used\nto estimate a a model of the housing and mortgage market in an effort\nto gauge the potential usefulness of each of the methods.},
