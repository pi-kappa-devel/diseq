"at_the_mean".}

\section{Functions}{
\itemize{
\item \code{system_marginal}: Marginal effect on market system

Returns the estimated marginal effect of a variable on the market system. For a
system variable \eqn{x} with demand coefficient \eqn{\beta_{d, x}} and supply
coefficient \eqn{\beta_{s, x}}, the marginal effect on the market system  is given by
\deqn{M_{x} = \frac{\beta_{d, x} - \beta_{s, x}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{d, x}^{2} +
\sigma_{s, x}^{2} - 2 \rho_{ds} \sigma_{d, x} \sigma_{s, x}}}.}

\item \code{shortage_probability_marginal}: Marginal effect on shortage probabilities

Returns the estimated marginal effect of a variable on the probability of observing
a shortage state. The mean marginal effect on the shortage probability is given by
\deqn{M_{x} \mathrm{E}\phi(D - S)}
and the marginal effect at the mean by
\deqn{M_{x} \phi(\mathrm{E}(D - S)),}
where \eqn{M_{x}} is the marginal effect on the system, \eqn{D} is the demanded
quantity, \eqn{S} the supplied quantity, and \eqn{\phi} is the standard normal
density.
