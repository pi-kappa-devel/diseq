\title{Estimation of models for markets in equilibrium and disequilibrium}
\description{
The \code{diseq} package provides tools to estimate and analyze an equilibrium and
four disequilibrium models. The equilibrium model can be estimated with either
two-stage least squares or with full information maximum likelihood. The methods are
asymptotically equivalent. The disequilibrium models are estimated using full
information maximum likelihood. All maximum likelihood models can be estimated both
with independent and correlated demand and supply shocks. The disequilibrium
estimation is based on Maddala and Nelson (1974) \doi{10.2307/1914215}. The package
is using the expressions of the gradients of the likelihoods derived in
Karapanagiotis (2020) \doi{10.2139/ssrn.3525622}.

Overview

This page gives an overview of the market model classes and the available
documentation options of the package.

\subsection{Usage}{
The easiest way to get accustomed with the functionality of the package is to check
the accompanying vignettes and the \href{../README.html}{README} file. These can be
found in the following links:

\describe{
  \item{\href{../doc/basic_usage.html}{basic_usage}}{
    \code{vignette("basic_usage", package = "diseq")}}
  \item{\href{../doc/market_clearing_assessment.html}{equilibrium_assessment}}{
    \code{vignette("market_clearing_assessment", package = "diseq")}}
}

Additionally, one can use the documentation examples. Some of them illustrate the
package functionality using the \code{\link{houses}} dataset.

\subsection{Market model classes}{
The model hierarchy is described in the \href{../README.html}{README} file. See
the documentation of the classes for initialization details.
