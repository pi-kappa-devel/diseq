\title{Market side aggregation.}
\usage{
aggregate_demand(object, parameters)

aggregate_supply(object, parameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model object.}

\item{parameters}{A vector of model's parameters.}
}
\value{
The sum of the estimated demanded or supplied quantities evaluated at the
given parameters.
}
\description{
Market side aggregation.
}
\details{
Calculates the sample's aggregate demand or supply at the passed set of
parameters. If the model is static, as is for example the case of
\code{\linkS4class{equilibrium_model}}, then all observation are aggregated. If the
used data have a time dimension and aggregation per date is required, it can be
manually performed using the \code{\link{demanded_quantities}} and
\code{\link{supplied_quantities}} functions. If the model has a dynamic component,
such as the \code{\linkS4class{diseq_deterministic_adjustment}}, then demanded
and supplied quantities are automatically calculated per date.
