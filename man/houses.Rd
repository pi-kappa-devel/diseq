}
\details{
\subsection{The basic houses dataset (\code{houses})}{

A dataset containing the monthly mortgage rates and other attributes of the US market
for new, non-farm houses from July 1958 to December 1969. The variables are as
follows:

\itemize{
  \item \code{DATE} The date of the record.
  \item \code{HS} Private non-farm housing starts in thousands of units
(Not seasonally adjusted).
  \item \code{RM} FHA Mortgage rate series on new homes in units of 100 (
beginning-of-month Data).
  \item \code{DSLA} Savings capital (deposits) of savings and loan associations in
millions of dollars.
  \item \code{DMSB} Deposits of mutual savings banks in millions of dollars.
  \item \code{DHLB} Advances of the federal home loan bank to savings and loan
associations in million of dollars.
  \item \code{W} Number of working days in month.
}
}

\subsection{Generate the variables of the Fair & Jaffee (1972) dataset.
(\code{fair_houses})}{

Loads the \code{\link{houses}} dataset and creates the additional variables used by
Fair & Jaffee (1972) \doi{10.2307/1913181}. These are
\itemize{
  \item \code{ID} A dummy entity identifier that is always equal to one since the
houses data have only a time series component.
  \item \code{DSF} Flow of deposits in savings and loan associations and mutual
savings banks in million of dollars. Equal to \deqn{DSLA_{t} + DMSB_{t} - (DSLA_{t-1}
+ DMSB_{t-1}).}
  \item \code{DHF} Flow of advances of the federal home loan bank to savings and loan
associations in million of dollars. Equal to \deqn{DHLB_{t} - DHLB_{t-1}.}
  \item \code{MONTH} The month of the date of the observation.
  \item \code{L1RM} FHA Mortgage rate series on new homes in units of 100, lagged by
one date.
  \item \code{L2RM} FHA Mortgage rate series on new homes in units of 100, lagged by
two dates.
  \item \code{L1HS} Private non-farm housing starts in thousands of units (Not
seasonally adjusted), lagged by one date.
  \item \code{CSHS} The cumulative sum of past housing starts. Used to proxy the
stock of houses
  \item \code{MA6DSF} Moving average of order 6 of the flow of deposits in savings
associations and loan associations and  mutual savings banks.
  \item \code{MA3DHF} Moving average of order 3 of the flow of advances of the
federal home loan bank to savings and loan associations.
  \item \code{TREND} A time trend variable.
